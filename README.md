# Real_Time_Embedded_System

### Main Objective
A real time system has to accept important temporal constraints. A real time embedded system must be able to react to events with a limited time.
In this repo, the measures of response time to interruptions are studied and tested in laboratories, such as for example the influence of dynamic memories, of cache memories, of option of compilation. 
Measurements of response time to the interruptions, tasks commutations, primitives of synchronizations are carried out on an embedded system based on a Altera System-on-Chip (SoC) FPGA, the [DE1-SoC](https://www.terasic.com.tw/cgi-bin/page/archive.pl?Language=English&No=836) board.
Multiprocessors, accelerators, custom instructions, specialized hardware are some ways to improve the performance of a specific application. Those concepts are developed through laboratories and a mini-project.
