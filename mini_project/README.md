# Edge Detection via Sobel algorithm

### Description
This project implements edge detection based on the Sobel operator. It reads an image from memory, does edge detection, and then displays the result binary image on a LCD screen.


### Project Structure

```
- edge detection
  - FIFO        % source code for FIFO generated by Quartus
    - FIFO.cmp
    - FIFO.qip
    - FIFO.vhd
  - test_image  % test images for our demo
    - original  % original images in .jpg/.ppm/.txt format
    - results   % result binary images after edge detection
      - LCD     % photos of displayed image on the LCD
      - python  % images computed in python notebook, used as comparison
  - test_multi  % test bench for sub-operations in the design
  - sobel_op.ipynb  % python notebook implementing sobel operators
